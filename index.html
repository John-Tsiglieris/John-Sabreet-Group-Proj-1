<h2>The Meaning of Shine on You Crazy Diamond</h2>

  <h3>Syd Barrett</h3>
  <p>Syd Barrett was, at one point in time, a professional musician. In fact his most-notable achievement is being the co-founder and initial frontman of Pink Floyd. However, his professional music career was short-lived, as he had serious mental issues in addition to problems related to illicit-drug abuse. Also another of his claims to fame is that from 1972 going he became infamously reclusive. Indeed despite the fact that his name remained famous in the UK and he received considerable royalties via Pink Floyd throughout the years, during the last three decades of his life he had completely withdrawn from the public spotlight.

He died in 2006 at the age of 60. Pancreatic cancer was what officially caused his death.</p>
